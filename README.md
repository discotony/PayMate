# PayMate - An iOS Digital Mobile Wallet App Built with SwiftUI

## Description
Welcome to PayMate, an innovative digital mobile wallet application (app) designed with a strong emphasis on animations and user interface (UI). This app offers a seamless and visually engaging experience for managing digital transactions with ease. Developed for both tech-savvy users and beginners alike, PayMate stands out with its unique animation-focused UI and intuitive design.

## Features
### 1. Dark Mode Support
PayMate is built with a dark mode feature, providing a user-friendly interface that's easy on the eyes, especially in low-light environments. This mode not only enhances visual comfort but also extends battery life on OLED displays.

### 2. UI Elements Animation
Experience smooth animations of UI elements as the keyboard appears and disappears. This feature ensures a fluid and responsive user experience, maintaining a consistent and elegant interface throughout.

### 3. Custom Launch Screen Animation
Our launch screen sets the tone for a dynamic experience with custom animations. Each image element is animated by configuring offsets, angles, speed, and directions from scratch, showcasing our commitment to a high-quality, library-independent approach.

### 4. Animated Sign-In Screen
The Sign-In screen features captivating animations for the welcome text and image. These elements are programmatically implemented, creating an inviting and interactive entry point into the app without relying on third-party libraries.

### 5. Optimized for Smaller Devices
PayMate is designed to support smaller devices efficiently. On screens with limited space, certain UI elements automatically disappear, prioritizing essential content while maintaining design consistency and user friendliness.

### 6. OTP Screen with Animation
The One-Time Password (OTP) screen includes custom animations for an enhanced user experience. Like other features, these animations are developed programmatically, ensuring a unique and cohesive look and feel.

### 7. Advanced Error Handling
PayMate smartly handles various error types related to phone number input:

- Error Type 1: Alerts for phone numbers that are too short or too long.
- Error Type 2: Notification for phone numbers starting with one.
- Error Type 3: Validation using the PhoneNumberKit Swift framework for incorrect phone numbers.

Status messages for these errors are displayed in real-time, guiding users in formatting while deactivating the submit button for incorrect inputs.

### 8. Successful Input Notification
Upon entering a valid phone number, users are promptly notified with a pop-up view, confirming the successful input and readying them for the next step in their PayMate experience.
